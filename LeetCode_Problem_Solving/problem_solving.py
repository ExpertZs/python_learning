#1480. Running Sum of 1d Array
#Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

#Return the running sum of nums.
#Example 1:

#Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
#Output: [1,3,6,10]
#Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
class Solution:

    def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        temp = 0
        output = []

#724. Find Pivot Index
#Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.
#The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.
#If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.
#Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1
#Example 1:
#Input: nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]
#Output: 3
#Explanation:
#The pivot index is 3.
#Left sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11
#Right sum = nums[4] + nums[5] = 5 + 6 = 11


class Solution:
    def pivotIndex(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        total=sum(nums)
        left_sum = 0
        for index in range(len(nums)):
            right_sum = total - nums[index] - left_sum
            if left_sum == right_sum:
                return index
            left_sum += nums[index]
        return -1

#LeetCode Problem 217. Contains Duplicate

#Leetcode Problem 53. Maximum Subarray
#Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.
#Example 1:
#Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
#Output: 6
#Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.

class Solution:

#LeetCode problem 205. Isomorphic Strings
#Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
#Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
#All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
#Example 1:
#Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
#Output: true

#LeetCode Problem 392. Is Subsequence
#Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
#A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
#Example 1:
#Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
#Output: true

class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:

#LeetCode Problem 1. Two Sum
#Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
#You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
#You can return the answer in any order.
#Example 1:
#Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
#Output: [0,1]
#Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

class Solution:

#LeetCode Problem 88. Merge Sorted Array
#You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
#Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
#The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
#Example 1:
#Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
#Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
#Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
#The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
