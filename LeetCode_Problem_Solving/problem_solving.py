#1480. Running Sum of 1d Array
#Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

#Return the running sum of nums.
#Example 1:

#Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
#Output: [1,3,6,10]
#Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
class Solution:

#724. Find Pivot Index
#Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.
#The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.
#If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.
#Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1
#Example 1:
#Input: nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]
#Output: 3
#Explanation:
#The pivot index is 3.
#Left sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11
#Right sum = nums[4] + nums[5] = 5 + 6 = 11

#Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

#Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

#You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
#Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
#The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

#LeetCode problem 142. Linked List Cycle II
#Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
#There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.

#Follow Up
#Can you solve it without using extra space?
#Methodology
#This is the extension quesion of 141. Linked List Cycle Now we want to return the start node of cycle
    #    We need to check if there is cycle
    #    If there is not cycle return None and if there is cycle we set slow pointer to head
#    If slow pointer and fast pointer are not equal we move 1 step for each pointer until the two pointer conincide, then we get the node of cycle begining.
#There are lots of explainations online, the best way to try is draw graph yourself. There is simple math behind. Here
    #    L1: the distance from head to start node of cycle
    #   L2: the distance from start node of cycle to crossing node of two pointers
    #    L3: the distance from crossing node of two pointers to start node of cycle
#Slow pointer to crossing node is L1+L2.
#Fast pointer to crossing node is 2(L1+L2) since fast pointer always move 2 times of slow pointer step.
#Fast pointer is also equal to L1+L2+L3+L2 because to meet with slow pointer, the fast pointer has to run over cycle at least 1 time.
#Therefor 2(L1+L2)=L1+L2+L3+L2 -> 2L1=L1+L3 -> L1 = L3
